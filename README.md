This GitHub repository serves as a centralized index and documentation hub for all my cybersecurity labs and projects. It is a platform for cybersecurity professionals and enthusiasts to share knowledge, develop and maintain security tools, and promote awareness of the latest trends and threats in the field. Through open-source contributions, we strive to enhance the security posture of individuals and organizations worldwide.

My journey has taken many twists and turns. I have a broad view of topics encountered in life, allowing me to remain flexible and calm under pressure. After seeing the direction the world has taken with the development and exploitation of technology, I have developed a passion, and I am eager to do my part in securing the globe. With a data-driven mindset I am passionate about both the nontechnical (compliance) side and the technical side of cybersecurity, constantly bridging the gap between GRC and the SOC by learning both strategies.
